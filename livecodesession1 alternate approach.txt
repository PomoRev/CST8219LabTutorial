DESIGN OF OBJECTS

card
// private data

    suit and a value

// constructors - deconstructor

    constructors
    
// utility functions (methods): show card, set temp value for joker.
    
    show card
    get suit
    get value
    get card


card deck
// private data

    collection of cards
    deck size
    build the deck based on number of cards

// constructors - deconstructor

    constructors for different numbers of cards

// utility functions: show deck (test), shuffle deck, draw card, reset deck

    show deck
    shuffle
    draw
    reset
    numberofcardsremaining


card hand
// private

    collection of cards

// constructors - deconstructor

    constructor for no cards
    constructor with one card to start
    constructor with a hand of cards

// utility functions: show hand, play card, sort by suit, sort by value, discard cards

    play card
    sort by value

================

Scratch Pad Thinking


CODE TO TEST

        build incrementally, test often



Object Oriented Design

Data (what it is)

    Encapsulation - Data (what it it) & Methods (what it does)

    Polymorphism - ( object inheritance, function and operator overloading)

    Abstraction - (black boxes)
